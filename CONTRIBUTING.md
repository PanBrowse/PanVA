# Contributing to _PanVA_

We appreciate all contributions to PanVA.
Thank you for helping us build this useful resource!

## Get in touch

There are many ways to get in touch with the _PanVA_ team!

- GitHub [issues][panva-issues] and [pull requests][panva-pr]
  - Join a discussion, collaborate on an ongoing task and exchange your thoughts with others. 
  - Can't find your idea being discussed anywhere?
    [Open a new issue](https://github.com/PanBrowse/PanVA/issues)! (See our [Where to start: issues](#where-to-start-issues) section below.)
- Contact the Project Lead of the _PanVA_ project - Sandra Smit - by email at [pantools@bioinformatics.nl](mailto:).

## Where to start: issues

Before you open a new issue, please check if any of our [open issues](https://github.com/PanBrowse/PanVA/issues) cover your idea already.

## Making a change with a merge request

The following steps are a guide to help you contribute in a way that will be easy for everyone to review and accept with ease.

### 1. Comment on an [existing issue][panva-issues] or open a new issue referencing your addition

This allows other members of the _PanVA_ team to confirm that you aren't overlapping with work that's currently underway and that everyone is on the same page with the goal of the work you're going to carry out.

### 2. Fork the [_PanVA_ repository][panva-repo]

This is now your own unique copy of _PanVA_.
Changes here won't affect anyone else's work, so it's a safe space to explore edits to the code!

### 3. Make the changes you've discussed

Try to keep the changes focused.
If you submit a large amount of work all in one go it will be much more work for whoever is reviewing your merge request.

While making your changes, commit often and write good, detailed commit messages.
[This blog](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) explains how to write a good Git commit message and why it matters.

Please do not re-write history!
That is, please do not use the [rebase](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/git/git_rebase.html) command to edit previous commit messages, combine multiple commits into one, or delete or revert commits that are no longer necessary.

### 4. Submit a [pull request][github-pr]

We encourage you to open a pull request (PR) as early in your contributing process as possible.
This allows everyone to see what is currently being worked on.
It also provides you, the contributor, feedback in real-time from both the community and the continuous integration as you make commits (which will help prevent stuff from breaking).

When you are ready to submit a PR, please describe in the pull request body:

- The problem you're trying to fix in the pull request, reference any related issue and use fixes/close to automatically close them, if pertinent.
- A list of changes proposed in the pull request.
- What the reviewer should concentrate their feedback on.

By providing as much detail as possible, you will make it really easy for someone to review your contribution!

If you have opened the pull request early and know that its contents are not ready for review or to be merged, add "[WIP]" at the start of the request title, which stands for "Work in Progress".
When you think it is ready to be merged into the main repository, change the "[WIP]" in the title of the merge request to "[Ready for review]".

A member of the _PanVA_ team will then review your changes to confirm that they can be merged into the main repository.
A review will probably consist of a few questions to help clarify the work you've done.
Keep an eye on your GitHub notifications and be prepared to join in that conversation.

You can update your fork of the _PanVA_ [repository][panva-repo] and the PR will automatically update with those changes.
