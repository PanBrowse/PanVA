We appreciate all contributions to PanVA.
Thank you for helping us build this useful resource!

## Get in touch

There are many ways to get in touch with the _PanVA_ team!

  - Join a discussion, collaborate on an ongoing task and exchange your thoughts with others. 
  - Can't find your idea being discussed anywhere?
    [Open a new issue](https://github.com/PanBrowse/PanVA/issues)! (See our [Where to start: issues](#where-to-start-issues) section below.)
- Contact the Project Lead of the _PanVA_ project - Sandra Smit - by email at [pantools@bioinformatics.nl](mailto:).

## Contributing through GitHub

The following steps are a guide to help you contribute in a way that will be easy for everyone to review and accept with ease.

### 1. Requirements

To make a contribution you will need to have:
- a github account
- a code editor like vs-code

To make edits you will need to:
- fork the PanVA repository
- clone your fork to your computer
- install the dependencies
- make changes
- push your changes to your fork
- submit a pull request

### 2. Comment on an [existing issue][panva-issues] or open a new issue referencing your addition

Before you open a new issue, please check if any of our [open issues](https://github.com/PanBrowse/PanVA/issues) cover your idea already.

This allows other members of the _PanVA_ team to confirm that you aren't overlapping with work that's currently underway and that everyone is on the same page with the goal of the work you're going to carry out.

### 3. Making a change with a pull request

#### 3.1 Fork the [_PanVA_ repository][panva-repo]

This is now your own unique copy of _PanVA_.
Changes here won't affect anyone else's work, so it's a safe space to explore edits to the code!
Make sure to [sync your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) with the upstream repo. 

#### 3.2 Make the changes you have discussed

Try to keep the changes focused.
If you submit a large amount of work all in one go it will be much more work for whoever is reviewing your merge request.

While making your changes, commit often and write good, detailed commit messages.
[This blog](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) explains how to write a good Git commit message and why it matters.


#### 3.3 Submit a [pull request][github-pr]

We encourage you to open a pull request (PR) as early in your contributing process as possible.
This allows everyone to see what is currently being worked on.
It also provides you, the contributor, feedback in real-time from both the community and the continuous integration as you make commits (which will help prevent stuff from breaking).

GitHub has a nice introduction to the [pull request workflow][github-pr-workflow], but please [get in touch](#get-in-touch) if you have any questions.


A member of the _PanVA_ team will then review your changes to confirm that they can be merged into the main repository.
A review will probably consist of a few questions to help clarify the work you've done.
Keep an eye on your GitHub notifications and be prepared to join in that conversation.

You can update your fork of the _PanVA_ [repository][panva-repo] and the PR will automatically update with those changes.
