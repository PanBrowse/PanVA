PanVA is web application allowing users to visually and interatively explore sequence variants in pangenomes. It provides context for these variants by displaying their corresponding annotations, phylogenetic and phenotypic information. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/PanBrowse/PanVA/tree/main).
